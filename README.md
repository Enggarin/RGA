# RGA
RGA is a dynamic simulation model of the distribution of traffic flows on the road network of settlements. Model calculations are performed with a user-specified time step. The path of the correspondences made are calculated based on the strategy of choosing the best path. Fundamental velocity / density relationships are used in the calculations of flow characteristics on hauls. The Highway capacity manual 2000 is used to assess the impact of regulated and unregulated intersections on the traffic flow. The project is in an early stage of development.
